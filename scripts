To create a new database in MySQL, you use the "CREATE DATABASE" statement with the following syntax

CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name
[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
[COLLATE collation_name]

First, you need to specify the database name which needs to be created after the CREATE DATABASE keywords.
The database name you are specifying here needs to be unique throughout the MySQL server instance. If the database name already exists, MySQL will give an error.

Second, optionally you can specify IF NOT EXIST which ensures that if the database already exist MySQL will not throw any error.

Third, optionally you can specify the character set and collation for the database. If not specify MySQL database will be created with default character set and collation.


You can create a database in MySQL in two methods:

Using MySQL Command Line Client
Using MySQL Workbench
